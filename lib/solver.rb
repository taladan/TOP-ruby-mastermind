   When we get to the point that we are trying to reduce the pool of numbers, we're going to take
   S = set of all possible solutions
   g = current_guess
   secret = '3344' (some cyper of length n)

   g = 1122
   feedback(g,code) -> against secret, g will return no correct positions

   feedback(S, g) -> 
   iterate through set of all possible solutions (ps), any solution in the set of all possible solutions
   that gives the SAME feedback as the original should be stored in the next set of possible solutions - because we
   are comparing each solution to the initial guess, if it gives 'no correct positions' as feedback, that will mean it
   is a set encompassing all numbers that exclude the values '1' and '2'.
